		<h2>Reading 2 - Discussion Answers</h2>
		
        <h3>1. In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</h3>

			<p>Sue invited the audience to ‘de-familiarize our tools’, and what it means by that, in my opinion, is to reflect and be more conscious of how we interact with technology. She uses poetry as a representation of how we should’ve seen/used to see technologies as. When we read a poem, we often find ourselves questioning its meaning to better understand ourselves. Today, when interacting with technology, we’re so used and familiar with how it works and skipped that crucial step. This is why Sue wants to remind us to treat digital tools and technology as poetry in order to contemplate our actions.</p>


		<h3>2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</h3>

			<p><b>Early Works</b>

<p>People have tried to make some sort of HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) since the early years of technology in order to retain those ‘consciousness’ although it still has a lot of technological limitations. However, as time evolved and we discovered more things, these early works are developed and kept being improved to achieve a smoother and better HCI. The idea is still the same­––to influence how one’s work is being experienced consciously by incorporating our senses.  Early works started from the military era and it showcases how people started to think of a way to work with limitations other than fighting against it. </p>

<p>An example of a taxonomy of tools poetic is a Virtual Reality. In relation to what Sue talked about; The Poetry of Tools, VR works beyond just visuals on the screen and interactions like skimming, pointing, clicking, scrolling, etc. VR engages with the audience through body movements and senses like hearing (sound effects/music background), 360 degrees experience (makes the audience feel present in the space), etc. This beyond virtual worlds experience, intentionally or not will lead us to question our actions; how we interact with digital technology itself. We could find a purpose and meaning through these actions and become conscious of our decisions.</p>

<p>A lot of websites has been incorporating VR in order to appeal to the audience, as well to deliver their goal and ideas better. Although most VR could be found in-game applications, here are some VR websites examples that I found:</p>

<p><b><a href="https://konterball.com/">https://konterball.com/</a></b> Konterball is a website to play ping-pong games virtually either through mouse movements on the screen or by VR. Either way, it uses our decisions to movement making in reality and translates it into digital technology.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://justdancenow.com/">https://justdancenow.com/</a></b> Just dance now is connected to an application on our phone; which our phone/other smaller devices that could be held by hand act as a motion tracker for a bigger screen that showcases dance movements one should follow. This is similar to what Myron Krueger, Videoplace, 1985 did; as it focuses on interactions between computers and humans.</p>

  <div class="overlay">A website is like a sky. There's a saying that the sky has no limit, at least visually. When we look at the sky, we often find ourselves reflecting on things we might not even think about in the middle of our fast-paced daily routine, but when we do take a moment to look at it we'll see things and found things we never thought we'll find before, and what we see could be different with what others see. We can imagine a lot of things just by looking at it with no limitations. The same goes for a website. From a visitor's POV, everyone doesn't always spend time on a certain website 24/7 but when they do they discover different things and goes through different experiences, even when they're looking at the same page. While from the creator's POV, they could create anything they want on their individual websites! It act as an open space that's connected to different aspects of life.</div>

        <h5>1. What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word “user”?</h5>

			<p>Liliana shows her concern and perspective regarding the notion of invisible “users” as stated by influential user interface designers, Don Norman. He changed the term “user” to “people”. This idea emerged since as new technology is developing, there’s this tendency to keep the user more conscious of the technology itself without realizing the presence of a device. This also leads to an argument of changing the term Interface design to experience design.</p>

			<p>Liliana thinks that the word user is a way to distinct the developer and the user. She believes that the word user is powerful and need to be protected as it acts as a reminder of the existence of “…two classes of people—developers and users”. If we lose this distinction, it means we’re taking away the user’s rights and opportunity to “… demand better software”, having control of their own experience, and the realization of them using a program/system and to navigate their way around even under a good amount of ambiguity.</p>


		<h5>2. What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</h5>

			<p>An ideal internet user for Liliana would be described as a “Universal User/Turing Complete User”. This idea of an ideal user is a user that given any circumstances would still have the ability to navigate their way around and achieve their own goals, regardless of the original purpose of a device or an application. The universal user’s mindset is flexible and similar to what was described as an “intelligent user”, who is whether consciously or unconsciously still challenge themselves through their actions while engaging with technology.</p>
		
		<h5>3. From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users”?</h5>


			<p>An example where there are “gaps that can be filled by users” in my experience recently is when using a buy-and-sell website such as Kijiji.com. I had to create an account in order to be able to interact with other users—by either making a listing or replying to one.</p>

			<p>This “gap” that can be filled by users can be seen throughout the whole process, as the users are the one who navigate their way around this website; from creating an account, searching for a specific item ( typing in the search bar, choosing the category, narrowing down the search through customizable search tools; price range, location, offer type, etc ), making a listing ( uploading images, videos, filling in the description and other required informations, etc ), replying to a listing ( creating a message, ticking the “reCAPTCHA” button, etc ), or even bookmarking posts for future needs. All of these steps are controlled by the user, and without the user doing these steps, the final goal of the website to help the user buy/sell something can’t be achieved.</p>

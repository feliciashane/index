<p>1. Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media because by having an individual website, the individual could be in charge entirely of how they want to make use of the website in order to express their creative freedom, goals, beliefs, especially for creative people who would like to share their perspectives. In this case, I somewhat agree with Schwulst said. Social media platforms do simplify a lot of things for their users, but their main goal as mentioned is not for the individuals, instead, it's for their business profit, etc which is fine because websites are made for different purposes. But these platforms have rules and limitations as to how far an individual could push the use of the website to mirror their identity, while especially artists and creative people tend to have amazing ideas and ways to communicate things which if we were to use those platforms could be too restrictive. An individual website could help the user create and change certain experiences and feelings for themselves and others, and I think it is a beautiful and powerful thing.</p>
